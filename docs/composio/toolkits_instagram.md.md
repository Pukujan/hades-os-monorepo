### Create Carousel Container

**Slug:** `INSTAGRAM_CREATE_CAROUSEL_CONTAINER`

Create a draft carousel post with multiple images/videos before publishing. Instagram requires carousels to have between 2 and 10 media items. Container creation_ids expire in under 24 hours, so publish promptly after creation.

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `caption` | string | No | Caption for the carousel post (maximum 2,200 characters) Maximum 30 hashtags. |
| `children` | array | No | List of child creation_ids (image/video items). Total carousel items across all sources must be between 2 and 10. All child containers must be in FINISHED status before use; pending or failed items will block carousel creation. Order of IDs determines slide sequence. |
| `ig_user_id` | string | Yes | Instagram Business Account ID Must be a Business or Creator account; personal accounts are rejected. |

Images must meet Instagram's requirements: JPEG format, aspect ratio between 4:5 (0.8) and 1.91:1, width between 320-1440px (images below 320px are scaled up, larger images are downscaled), maximum file size 8MB. URLs must be publicly accessible by Instagram's servers. Total carousel items across all sources must be between 2 and 10. Must be direct HTTPS URLs (not HTML pages, redirects, or generic Google Drive share links); use a public direct-download link. |

### Create Media Container (Deprecated)

**Slug:** `INSTAGRAM_CREATE_MEDIA_CONTAINER`

DEPRECATED: Use INSTAGRAM_POST_IG_USER_MEDIA instead. Creates a draft media container for photos/videos/reels before publishing. Business/Creator accounts only — personal accounts unsupported. Returns a container ID (data.id or data.creation_id) used as creation_id for publishing. Containers expire in ~24 hours — recreate stale containers rather than reusing old IDs. Before publishing via INSTAGRAM_CREATE_POST, call INSTAGRAM_GET_POST_STATUS and wait for FINISHED status — publishing before FINISHED triggers error 9007. Each creation_id is one-time-use; if container creation fails (status_code='ERROR'), fix media params and recreate via this tool rather than retrying publish with the failed ID.

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `caption` | string | No | Post caption text. Maximum 2,200 characters. Hashtag limit: 30 hashtags maximum per post (Instagram enforces this limit). Mention limit: 20 @mentions maximum. |
| `cover_url` | string | No | Cover image URL for videos. For feed videos (content_type='video'), if image_url is not provided, this will be used as the required thumbnail. For reels, this is optional. |
| `image_url` | string | No | Public URL of the image. CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS: (1) Must be a DIRECT link to the raw image file - no redirects, no authentication, no HTML wrappers. (2) Must be publicly accessible by Meta's crawlers (URLs from Google Drive, dynamic API endpoints, or generated URLs like 'backend.composio.dev/dynamic-module-load/...' will NOT work). (3) Must return proper HTTP 200 status with correct Content-Type header (image/jpeg or image/png). (4) Supported formats: JPG, PNG (WebP not supported). Max 8MB, min 320px width, aspect ratio 4:5 to 1.91:1. RECOMMENDED: Use image hosting services like Imgur, Cloudinary, AWS S3 (public), or similar that provide direct download URLs. For feed videos (content_type='video'), this parameter is required as a thumbnail. |
| `video_url` | string | No | Public URL of the video. CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS: (1) Must be a DIRECT link to the raw video file - no redirects, no authentication, no HTML wrappers. (2) Must be publicly accessible by Meta's crawlers (URLs from Google Drive, dynamic API endpoints, or generated URLs will NOT work). (3) Must return proper HTTP 200 status with correct Content-Type header (video/mp4 or video/quicktime). (4) Supported formats: MP4, MOV. Max 100MB for feed videos, max 1GB for IGTV, min 3 seconds duration. RECOMMENDED: Use video hosting services or cloud storage like AWS S3 (public), Cloudinary, or similar. |
| `ig_user_id` | string | No | Instagram Business Account ID (numeric string like '17841400008460056'). Optional - defaults to the current authenticated user. Do NOT pass Composio connection IDs (starting with 'ca_') or other auth identifiers. |
| `media_type` | string | No | Explicit media type override (IMAGE, REELS, or CAROUSEL). If not provided, media_type is automatically inferred: IMAGE for image_url, REELS for video_url. IMPORTANT: Each media_type has specific URL requirements: IMAGE requires image_url; REELS requires video_url. NOTE: VIDEO media_type was deprecated on November 9, 2023. If VIDEO is provided, it will be automatically converted to REELS. |
| `content_type` | string ("photo" | "video" | "reel" | "carousel_item") | No | What you want to post: 'photo', 'video', 'reel', or 'carousel_item' (for carousel drafts) |
| `is_carousel_item` | boolean | No | Legacy parameter to mark media as a carousel item. Prefer using content_type='carousel_item' instead, which automatically sets this flag. When creating carousel items, you must provide either image_url or video_url. Carousels support a maximum of 10 items; each item must independently satisfy format, size, and aspect-ratio constraints. |
| `graph_api_version` | string | No | The Facebook Graph API version to use for the request. |

#### Output

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|

### Create Post (Deprecated)

**Slug:** `INSTAGRAM_CREATE_POST`

DEPRECATED: Use INSTAGRAM_POST_IG_USER_MEDIA_PUBLISH instead. Publish a draft media container to Instagram (final publishing step). Posts become immediately and publicly visible upon success — confirm intent before calling. Requires Business or Creator account with publish scopes; missing scopes return Graph error code 10. After creating a media container, Instagram may need time to process media before publishing. If called too early, error code 9007 is returned. This action automatically retries with exponential backoff (up to ~44 seconds total). For large videos, use INSTAGRAM_GET_POST_STATUS to poll until status_code='FINISHED' before calling; for carousels, all child containers must individually reach FINISHED status first. No native scheduling support — use an external scheduler to trigger this call at the desired time.

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `ig_user_id` | string | Yes | Instagram Business Account ID. Must be a numeric string (e.g., '25162441193410545'). Personal accounts and misconfigured IDs are rejected. |

Typically a long numeric string like '17895695668004550'. IMPORTANT: Do NOT use datetime strings (e.g., '2024-01-15T10:30:00+0000') - those are unrelated fields in Instagram responses. The container ID is found in the response like: {'id': '17895695668004550'}. Containers expire after ~24 hours; recreate via INSTAGRAM_CREATE_MEDIA_CONTAINER if stale. |
| `graph_api_version` | string | No | The Facebook Graph API version to use for the request. |

Requires a Business or Creator account; personal accounts cannot access insights. Metrics may be unavailable for several minutes after publishing; verify post status is FINISHED before calling.

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `metric` | array | No | Metrics to retrieve for the media. If not provided and metric_preset is not set, uses auto_safe preset.

Note: 'engagement' and 'impressions' are NOT valid standalone metrics - use individual metrics like likes, comments, saved, shares instead. If a metric is unsupported for the post type, API returns 400 error. Some metrics (e.g., shares) may return null even for supported media types; handle missing values before computing ratios. |
| `ig_post_id` | string | Yes | Numeric Instagram Media ID from the Graph API (e.g., '17895695668004196'). This must be the numeric ID, NOT the shortcode from Instagram URLs (e.g., 'DT0ndbTgcLH' from instagram.com/p/DT0ndbTgcLH/ will NOT work).

If status_code='ERROR' or remains non-terminal after ~30 attempts, the container is permanently failed — recreate a new container. Poll every 3–5s with exponential backoff to avoid error 613/code 4/HTTP 429. For carousels, all child containers must reach FINISHED before publishing the parent.

#### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `creation_id` | string | Yes | The media container ID returned from INSTAGRAM_CREATE_MEDIA_CONTAINER action.
