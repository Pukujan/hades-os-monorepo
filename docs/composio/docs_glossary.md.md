### Auth Config

A blueprint defining how authentication works for a toolkit: auth method (OAuth2, API key, Bearer token, Basic Auth), scopes, and credentials. Created automatically by a [session](/docs/how-composio-works) when needed. You can [create a custom one](/docs/auth-configuration/custom-auth-configs) to use your own OAuth credentials or non-default scopes.

### Auth Scheme

The authentication method used by an auth config, such as `OAUTH2`, `API_KEY`, `BEARER_TOKEN`, or `BASIC`.

### Callback URL

The URL a user is redirected to after completing an OAuth flow through a Connect Link. Passed as `callbackUrl` when initiating authentication.

### Composio API Key

A project-scoped secret used to authenticate SDK and API requests. All resources created with it are scoped to that project.

### Composio Managed Auth

The default mode where Composio provides its own OAuth app credentials for each toolkit. No setup required.

### Connect Link

A hosted page where a user authorizes access to a toolkit. Returned as a `redirect_url` from `session.authorize()` or `connectedAccounts.initiate()`. Composio manages the full OAuth flow. See [Authentication](/docs/authentication).

### Connected Account

Created when a user authenticates with a toolkit. Stores credentials (OAuth tokens or API keys) linked to a user ID. Composio automatically refreshes OAuth tokens. A user can have [multiple connected accounts](/docs/managing-multiple-connected-accounts) for the same toolkit. IDs are prefixed `ca_`.

### Connection Request

The object returned when you initiate authentication. Contains the Connect Link URL and a `waitForConnection()` method that resolves once the user completes the flow.

### Custom Tool

A user-defined tool used alongside Composio's built-in tools. Use local experimental custom tools and custom toolkits via [Custom tools and toolkits](/docs/toolkits/custom-tools-and-toolkits).

### In-Chat Authentication

A flow where the AI agent handles authentication by calling `COMPOSIO_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` to generate a Connect Link and send it to the user in the conversation. See [In-chat authentication](/docs/authenticating-users/in-chat-authentication).

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

An open protocol for connecting AI models to external tools. Every session exposes `session.mcp.url` and `session.mcp.headers`, an MCP-compatible endpoint any MCP client can connect to.

### Manual Authentication

Authenticating users from your own code using `session.authorize()` or `connectedAccounts.initiate()`, as opposed to letting the AI agent handle it via in-chat authentication. See [Manual authentication](/docs/authenticating-users/manually-authenticating).

### Meta Tools

A set of tools included in every session, including `COMPOSIO_SEARCH_TOOLS`, `COMPOSIO_GET_TOOL_SCHEMAS`, `COMPOSIO_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS`, `COMPOSIO_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL`, `COMPOSIO_REMOTE_WORKBENCH`, and `COMPOSIO_REMOTE_BASH_TOOL`. They let the agent discover tools, manage auth, execute in parallel, and run code without loading hundreds of tool definitions upfront. See [Meta Tools Reference](/reference/meta-tools).

### Modifiers

Middleware that transforms tool behavior: [schema modifiers](/docs/tools-direct/modify-tool-behavior/schema-modifiers) change a tool's schema before the agent sees it, [before-execution modifiers](/docs/tools-direct/modify-tool-behavior/before-execution-modifiers) modify arguments before a tool runs, [after-execution modifiers](/docs/tools-direct/modify-tool-behavior/after-execution-modifiers) transform the result. In Python, [`@before_file_upload`](/docs/tools-direct/modify-tool-behavior/before-execution-modifiers#before-file-upload-python) intercepts local paths for `file_uploadable` parameters before read/upload.

### Native Tools

Tools accessed through provider packages via `session.tools()`, as opposed to connecting via MCP (`session.mcp.url`). Both methods give the agent the same capabilities, but native tools integrate directly with your AI framework.

### Organization

The top-level Composio account entity. Contains team members and projects.

### Organization API Key

A key (`x-org-api-key`) for organization-level operations like creating and managing projects. Distinct from the project-scoped Composio API Key.

### Project

An isolated environment within an organization that scopes API keys, connected accounts, auth configs, and webhooks. Resources in one project are inaccessible from another. IDs are prefixed `proj_`. See [Projects](/docs/projects).

### Proxy Execute

Making authenticated HTTP requests through a toolkit's connected account without a predefined tool. Useful for API endpoints Composio doesn't have a built-in tool for.

### Provider

An adapter package that transforms Composio tools into the format expected by an AI framework (OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, Vercel AI SDK, etc.). See [Providers](/docs/providers).

### Session

An ephemeral configuration object from `composio.create(userId)`. Ties together a user ID, available toolkits, auth config, and connected accounts. Immutable. Exposes `tools()`, `mcp.url`, `authorize()`, and `toolkits()`. See [What is a session?](/docs/how-composio-works).

### Session ID

Unique identifier for a session. Used internally by meta tools to share context across calls within the same session.

### Tool

An individual action an agent can execute. Has an input schema and output schema. Named `{TOOLKIT}_{ACTION}` (e.g., `GITHUB_CREATE_ISSUE`).

### Tool Slug

A tool's unique identifier, following the `{TOOLKIT}_{ACTION}` pattern, e.g. `GITHUB_CREATE_ISSUE`.

### Toolkit

A collection of related tools for a single external service. Users connect to a toolkit via authentication, and all its tools execute with the user's credentials.

### Toolkit Slug

The lowercase identifier for a toolkit, e.g. `github`, `gmail`, `slack`. Used when configuring sessions, fetching tools, or creating triggers.

### Toolkit Versioning

Pinning a toolkit to a specific version so your integration uses a consistent set of tools even as Composio updates definitions. See [Toolkit versioning](/docs/tools-direct/toolkit-versioning).

### Trigger

Sends structured payloads to your application when something happens in a connected app. Two delivery types: **webhook** (the provider pushes events in real time, e.g. Slack, GitHub, Asana) and **polling** (Composio polls the provider on a schedule, e.g. Gmail). See [Triggers](/docs/triggers).

### Trigger Instance

A specific, active trigger scoped to a user's connected account.

### Webhook Endpoint

The ingress URL Composio issues per OAuth app for webhook triggers, plus the signing secret used to verify each inbound request. Composio configures it for you in most cases. When a trigger type's `requires_webhook_endpoint_setup` flag is true, you configure it yourself once per OAuth app via the [Webhook Endpoints API](/reference/api-reference/webhook-endpoints). See [Configuring the webhook endpoint](/docs/setting-up-triggers/creating-triggers#configuring-the-webhook-endpoint).

### Webhook Subscription

The URL Composio delivers signed events to in your application. One per project, configured via the dashboard or the [Webhook Subscriptions API](/reference/api-reference/webhook-subscriptions). See [Subscribing to events](/docs/setting-up-triggers/subscribing-to-events).

### User ID

An identifier from your application that Composio uses to scope connected accounts, tool executions, and authorizations. Connections are fully isolated between user IDs. See [What is a session?](/docs/how-composio-works).

### White-Labeling

Customizing the auth experience so users see your brand during the OAuth flow. You provide your own OAuth credentials, redirect URIs, and branding. See [White-labeling authentication](/docs/white-labeling-authentication).

### Workbench

A persistent Python sandbox via the `COMPOSIO_REMOTE_WORKBENCH` meta tool. State persists across calls within a session. Used for bulk operations, data transformations, and processing large tool responses. See [Workbench](/docs/workbench).
